                Mahabalipuram (75 Kms/ 2 Hrs approximately) Mahabalipuram lies on the Coromandel Coast which faces the Bay of Bengal.
                This is an elegant place to watch which a well established sea port was during the 7th and 10th centuries of the Pallava
                dynasty. This was the second capital of the Pallavas who ruled Kanchipuram. Formerly, Mahabalipuram was known and called
                as Mahabalipuram. The former name of this place 'Mahabalipuram' has a history. A very rude cruel king Mahabali reined
                this place and in a fierce battle king Mahabali was killed by Lord Vishnu and the place was named after the dead King.
                Arrive Mahabalipuram & transfer to the Hotel.

                peninsula, Pondicherry is a seaside resort. But at the same time it differs very much from a typical beach resort.
                Tourist attractions in Pondicherry lie in its ambience. Old French style buildings, churches and museums, tree-lined
                boulevards along the seashore would remind you of a bygone era. The Laidback Township, pristine beach and the palm trees
                swaying in breeze bring a slice of serenity. The only sound you can hear is the waves crashing against the rocks and the
                chirping of the birds. But to cap it all, the Auroville Ashram is the biggest of all tourist attractions in Pondicherry.
                Just because of it, the destination of Pondicherry exudes a spiritual aura. For the weary soul, this is an ideal
                retreat. Any evening head for the Ashram meditate, soothe the battered psyche. It consists of four former French coastal
                settlements whose administration was transferred to India in 1954. Arrive Pondicherry & transfer to the Hotel.

                Kulasekarar built a great temple and created a lotus shaped city around the temple. On the day the city was to be named,
                as Lord Shiva blessed the land and its people, divine nectar (Madhu) was showered on the city from his matted locks.
